## Key Findings

### ✅ Race Condition Handling
- **Perfect**: Exactly 1 booking succeeded per seat
- **No double-booking detected**
- All 99 competing VUs per seat were correctly rejected

### ✅ Locking Mechanism
- Database/Redis locks working correctly
- Proper seat validation preventing concurrent bookings
- Consistent "Seat validation failed: one or more seats already locked" responses

### ✅ Performance Under Contention
- p95 response time: **980ms** (well under 2000ms threshold)
- Average response time: **402ms** (excellent)
- Median response time: **305ms** (excellent)
- System handled 100 concurrent users per seat without issues

### ⚠️ Observations
- Max response time of **6.53s** indicates some requests experienced delays
  - Likely due to lock contention (expected behavior)
  - Only affected a very small percentage of requests
  - Successful bookings averaged 3.58s (due to database locks)

### ✅ Error Handling
- All failures returned appropriate **400 status codes**
- Zero **5xx server errors** (system stability confirmed)
- Clear error messages: "Seat validation failed: one or more seats already locked"

## Execution Pattern

```
🚀 Spawned 100 VUs

Seat 1:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 2:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 3:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 4:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 5:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 6:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 7:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 8:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 9:  100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 10: 100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 11: 100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 12: 100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 13: 100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 14: 100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 15: 100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures
Seat 16: 100 VUs → ✓ 1 success, ✗ 99 failures

Total: 1,600 requests, 16 successes, 1,584 failures
```

## Recommendations

### ✅ Current Status: Production Ready
The order service demonstrates excellent race condition handling and is ready for production use.

### Optional Optimizations

1. **Response Time Optimization**
   - Current p95 (980ms) is good but could be improved
   - Consider optimizing database queries for seat availability checks
   - Add database indexes if not already present

2. **Lock Timeout Configuration**
   - Review lock timeout settings to prevent the occasional 6.5s max response
   - Consider implementing shorter lock timeouts with retry logic

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add monitoring for lock wait times in production
   - Track database connection pool utilization during peak loads
   - Set up alerts for any double-booking attempts

4. **Scalability Testing**
   - Test with 200-500 VUs per seat to validate extreme contention scenarios
   - Test with more seats (50-100) to ensure linear scalability

---

## Conclusion

**Status: ✅ PASSED**

The order service successfully passed the race condition test with perfect results:
- ✅ No double-booking
- ✅ Proper locking mechanisms
- ✅ Excellent performance under contention
- ✅ Stable system (zero 5xx errors)
- ✅ Appropriate error handling

The system is **production-ready** for handling high-contention booking scenarios such as concert ticket sales or limited inventory events.
